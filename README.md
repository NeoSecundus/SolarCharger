# Solar Charger

**DISCLAIMER: I cannot guarantee that this works with every setup. With the download of this repository you agree that everything you do with the repository is at your own risk.**

## Basic Information

Arduino Based Voltage Transformer for Small Solar Panels. Should always supply 5V (Typical USB Voltage). 

You may not need the exact parts that I used for this Project and the code should work with most Arduino-based microcontrollers. I recommend that you understand everything that happens in this circuit before you try to make changes or rebuild the project at all.

## Requirements

You may need to download additional requirements. The includes in the "SolarCharger.ino" file will show you which ones you need. Just download the missing dependencies from the built-in Arduino library manager.

If you need help with anything just email or dm me. :)
